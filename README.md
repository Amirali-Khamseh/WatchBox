### Features :

1. **Hot Trending Content:** On the main index page of the application, a dedicated section showcases the hottest trending movies. Presented in an engaging slider format, this section animates to catch your attention. The content is regularly updated to include new and popular releases.
1. **Efficient Search:** Seamlessly search through the extensive database of movies and shows. Users can receive up to 20 relevant search items related to their search topic. In cases where there are even more results available, a user-friendly pagination feature has been implemented, enabling navigation through the results with ease.
1. **Detailed Information:** Once you locate the desired item or items using the search feature, you will gain access to essential details, including titles and viewer ratings. For a deeper understanding, navigate to the dedicated details section for the specific movie or show.
